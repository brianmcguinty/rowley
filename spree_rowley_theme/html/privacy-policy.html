On the Internet, when you see either a solid key icon or a locked padlock icon at the lower portion of your browser window, this indicates that the site is secured through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Pages requesting personal information should always have one of these icons. Although we use commercially reasonable efforts to protect the security of your personal information and our system, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, no transmission via the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result of this and other factors beyond our control, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you transmit to or through our Sites.  Therefore, you assume that risk by using the Sites.
